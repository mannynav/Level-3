The code in this repo are exercise solutions to the Quant Net C++ course "C++ Programming for Financial Engineering". It is really an introductory C++ course, so most of the levels do not have anything to do with quantitative finance. Some of the homework questions have been joined with others in the same level because they are just extensions of previous problems and levels 1 and 2 are not included because they were done using C syntax.
